[Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) is a fascinating platform, where everyone can publish their music in high-quality format, without censorship or copyright issues. You can set arbitrary price for your art and all money except of 15% will go directly to you, while a buyer gets FLAC download and unlimited on-line streaming. There is also an option to set 'zero or more' price called 'name your price' or NYP. It is commonly used for albums released under Creative Commons license.

Unfortunately, the discovery system of Bandcamp is not that perfect. Let say you cannot get all releases with a certain tag for a specific year, or separate singles from LPs & EPs. Also there's no straight way to search for free/NYP releases. So this project is a way to think about how these situation may be improved.
